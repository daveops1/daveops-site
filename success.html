						<b>Business As Usual: Bill Pay System Replacement</b>

							if system was not delivered on time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#change">[read more&#8230;]</a>
						</p>
						<h4><i class="fa fa-university fa- "></i>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a id="business"></a>Business As
							Usual: Bill Pay System Replacement</h4>
						<p><strong>THE SITUATION</strong><br />
							While at a prestigious bank in L.A., serving as the Implementation Manager and
							&#8220;Build Master&#8221; for our development team, our current bill payment vendor we
							integrated with was sunsetting its bill pay service, essentially pulling the plug on its
							service. Our business and entertainment industry clients rely on our banking systems to
							pay their bills, so any current integrations with their accounting system would cease to
							function, which would cost our bank millions of lost dollars in revenue if we
							didn&#8217;t quickly find and integrate with a new bill payment vendor.</p>
						<p><strong>THE TASK</strong><br />
							My mission, with no choice but to accept it: work with our project team to quickly find
							a new bill payment vendor system and integrate with it, where clients can continue to do
							business as usual, paying their bills through their accounting systems which integrated
							in our banking systems.</p>
						<p><strong>AND&#8230;ACTION!</strong><br />
							I had to develop and keep accurate and current documentation, a clean and consistent
							software code repository, functioning development and testing environments and lead our
							implementation team to perform a successful integration with the new bill payment vendor
							system we had chosen. This all had to happen before the plug was pulled on our existing
							bill pay system. We had to do a clean cut-over to the new system without any loss of
							current functionality or downtime for our clients.</p>
						<p><strong>THE RESULT</strong><br />
							The result was not only business as usual for our clients, after our successful
							implementation, but even a significant cost and time savings for the bank and our
							clients! The processing time was cut down significantly as it was now real-time
							processing. Reconciliation was done faster and more accurately, saving even more time
							and money for the bank. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in cost and thousands of hours
							were saved both at the bank and our clients. Millions of dollars continued to
							successfully flow through our system the first day after the new system was
							implemented.&nbsp; <a href="#top">[&#8230;back to top]</a></p>
						<h4><i class="fa fa-balance-scale fa- "></i>&nbsp;<a id="balance"></a>A Tale of Competing
							Projects</h4>
						<p><strong>THE SITUATION</strong><br />
							While in the public sector, I was responsible for serving two departments: the Fire
							Department and the Business License Department.&nbsp; Both had very different
							priorities, agendas and perspectives.&nbsp; The Fire Department was a very structured
							and paramilitary organization while the Business License Department was primarily
							focused on tax revenue and compliance.&nbsp; Both had competing and largely conflicting
							priorities and deadlines, and I had to manage the expectations of both
							departments.&nbsp; The Fire Department was facing potential fines from state and federal
							agencies and even risking firefighters&#8217; lives due to growing staff hires in agency
							and only having a manual paper based process for inspecting and maintaining firefighter
							PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).&nbsp; Due to growth in new businesses, the Business
							License Department needed to give new and existing business owners a more efficient way
							to apply for and renew their business licenses.&nbsp; This would also lead to more tax
							revenue for the department and help sustain future growth.</p>
						<p><strong>THE TASK</strong><br />
							I had to deliver both projects on time and within budget, even though there were many
							time, scheduling and resource constraints.&nbsp; I had a very small team that was
							responsible for serving both departments.&nbsp; We handled operational needs as well as
							project needs for both departments, so it was very important for me to ensure proper
							time management and resource allocation, which required innovative planning and
							developing a systematized way of getting things done.&nbsp; I was held to high
							accountability standards by my direct managers, who also had their own priorities and
							agendas, apart from the other two departments.&nbsp; Essentially, I had to juggle three
							competing stakeholder groups and ensure both projects were successfully delivered and
							met each different sets of expectations and priorities to all parties&#8217;
							satisfaction.&nbsp; And I was the single point of contact and accountable for both
							projects.</p>
						<p><strong>AND&#8230;ACTION!</strong><br />
							From the very beginning of the projects, I had to be very intentional with setting and
							managing expectations for project scope and deliverables.&nbsp; I had to utilize problem
							solving, multiple technology frameworks, leadership and tact when dealing with the
							competing stakeholders of both projects.&nbsp; I also rolled up my sleeves to get in and
							work on system development efforts as we had a small team that served both
							departments.&nbsp; Since we also served the operational needs of the department, we
							still needed to &#8220;keep the lights on&#8221; while continuing to make progress on
							our project tasks and milestone deadlines.&nbsp; Because of this, I needed to establish
							a solid framework for juggling both project tasks and operational tasks.&nbsp; I took
							requirements from both projects, managed stakeholders expectations empathically,
							diplomatically and tactfully to keep projects at manageable ability to deliver on
							time.&nbsp; I had to pioneer new ways of doing things to effectively meet needs of all
							three stakeholder groups (specifically, my manager and the two departmental managers)
							with all three different viewpoints, perspectives, priorities and agendas.&nbsp; Because
							I had to utilize multiple tech frameworks and stacks, I needed to quickly switch gears
							between projects to make sure systems were being properly coded, tested and implemented.
						</p>
						<p><strong>THE RESULT</strong><br />
							<img align="left" src="http://www.davidhorton.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BusinessLicenseAward-300x234.png"> Both projects were finally delivered on
							time and to the satisfaction of my direct manager and the mangers of both Fire and
							Business License Departments.&nbsp; The Fire Department saved potentially tens of
							thousands of dollars in fines, and not to mention potential injury of firefighters due
							to lack of properly maintained PPE!&nbsp; I built an automated inventory management
							system, with automated workflows and reporting to make sure all PPE was properly
							inspected and maintained.&nbsp; Business License had a new online license application
							and renewal website which gave them an increase in tax revenue close to millions of
							dollars a year.&nbsp; This new system increased license revenue and made workflows much
							more efficient for staff, saving many hours of labor.&nbsp; The Business License
							Department Director also gave me an award for being the &#8220;Stretchy Superhero&#8221;
							because I was able to effectively manage both departmental needs and priorities while
							still delivering and meeting stakeholder expectations.&nbsp; Because of this, I also
							received a promotion to senior level position because of my effective project
							management, team leadership, problem solving skills, efficiently getting things done on
							time and delivering on my promises.&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="#top">[&#8230;back to top]</a>
						</p>
						<h4><i class="fa fa-trophy fa- "></i>&nbsp;<a id="change"></a>Championing Change</h4>
						<p><strong>THE SITUATION</strong><br />
							I was brought on as technical lead and co-project manager on a large-scale law
							enforcement project involving local, state and federal agencies of the Justice and
							Public Safety sector with a user community of over 20,000.&nbsp; The project was to
							rewrite and replace a legacy mainframe system built in the 1960&#8217;s from the ground
							up.&nbsp; There was one problem, however.&nbsp; The core group of developers from a
							consulting agency all left and there was a large turnover.&nbsp; This significantly set
							the project back due to training new staff, bringing them up to speed on the project
							where the previous developers left off.&nbsp; In addition, the user community was
							extremely resistant to change, wanting to keep the status quo.&nbsp; They were not
							concerned with underlying technology, not realizing that it was a ticking time bomb from
							an old technology and server infrastructure standpoint.&nbsp; All the expertise and
							knowledge of the technical aspects and coding of this system either moved on or
							retired.&nbsp; This created a huge knowledge and expertise gap that needed to be
							addressed immediately.</p>
						<p><strong>THE TASK</strong><br />
							I was brought on to help get the project back on track as it was under tight federal
							grant funding deadlines.&nbsp; There were many strong personalities involved that needed
							to be diplomatically handled due to large user community and diverse stakeholder group
							with often times competing agendas and priorities.&nbsp; I needed to be a diplomatic,
							strategic and empathetic listener and leader.&nbsp; The grant funding deadlines also
							needed to be effectively managed, ensuring proper management of workload and vendor
							involvement.&nbsp; The scope of the project had to also be tactfully managed, ensuring
							core features and functions met diverse user community and multi-agency stakeholders
							needs.</p>
						<p><strong>AND&#8230;ACTION!</strong><br />
							My work was cut out for me!&nbsp; I had to engage the user community and strategically
							and tactically win over and gain support of key user community power-users to champion
							the new system and assist with training the rest of the user community.&nbsp; I also
							worked to effectively delegate training and distribution of materials to the power-users
							so they could work with their respective user community groups (train the
							trainer).&nbsp; One of the biggest challenges was that the user community needed to be
							convinced of benefits of new system and an effective training plan needed to be quickly
							developed to help them learn new system efficiently and painlessly as possible.&nbsp; So
							I worked with the stakeholders to come up with good training plan for their user
							community.&nbsp; I also had to help show end-result benefits of the new system as I
							tried to gain support of user community and their cooperation with testing and learning
							new system.&nbsp; I strategically partnered with the business side of the stakeholder
							group and developed good rapport and close working relationships to handle schedule,
							training, workloads, QA and issue resolutions.&nbsp; I also had to quickly come up to
							speed and learn new technologies (using SharePoint, BizTalk, Team Foundation Server and
							SQL Server) so I could roll up my sleeves and help with getting new developers up to
							speed, as well as getting features out quickly for testing.&nbsp; In addition, I had to
							be an empathetic listener and diplomatically handle conflicting stakeholder agendas and
							concerns while continuing to drive project forward and prevent scope creep.</p>
						<p><strong>THE RESULT</strong><br />
							All the hard work paid off when I was able to successfully deploy and implement all
							system components, working with our network and server infrastructure group to
							coordinate all go-live activities.&nbsp; The user community was very happy with the new
							system as much effort was spent winning them over and effectively training them, helping
							them feel comfortable ahead of time with new system before it went live.&nbsp; There was
							also better reporting and auditing capabilities so all agencies and user communities
							would be in compliance with federal Justice and Public Safety regulations and
							policies.&nbsp; The new system also had better security and user management, preventing
							potential theft of user data and fraud, saving departments and agencies millions of
							dollars in having to conduct security audits.&nbsp; The graphical user interface (GUI)
							instead of a &#8220;green screen&#8221; terminal increased user productivity ten-fold
							and prevented the potential for errors in data entry (this was especially important as
							this system was used for tracking felons and people with a criminal history
							record).&nbsp; The system was also easier to support as the technology stack is now
							relevant and within current staff skillsets.&nbsp; The technology is also future-proof
							as it is using Microsoft technology which will be in support for many years to
							come.&nbsp; Because of the success of the project, I received an award from our Chief
							Information Officer and was featured in the news about the successful implementation and
							better, more reliable system for enhanced public safety.&nbsp; In summary, the benefits
							and cost savings of new system saved the agencies $8 million a year.&nbsp; We also
							received the 2014 Best of NIEM (National Information Exchange Model) award (<a
